This Readme will build from github action

As the past year, I learn a lot from open source.

But I am clear now that I wrote some simple code in the past.

There no more technical.

So I decide enroll in some lower level systematic code, such as
- ESC(Entity System Component) for game
- Machine Learning
- Backend into some auth manager
- Computer Graphics In Rust

These are goals in 2023 year!

Let's do it.

I'm still confused in all the stuff.

I started Machine Learning study on https://github.com/weykon/data-science-N-machine-learning  

And Graphics in Rust anything I found on https://github.com/weykon/computer-graphics-kindergarten
